A variation on Wilsons formula using modular arithmetic has been used - this replaces what is within the 'cosine' part of the function.

Note on factorial caching (for modular_factorial_recur function):
A cache limit (#define RECUR_CACHE_LIMIT) of 22 has been set because of the limitations imposed by integer data types

The largest integer that can be stored in a LLU int is 2^64: 21! is the largest factorial that can be stored. The cache indexes match the value for factorial therefor the '0'th index is 0!, and [21] with provide 21!.

<!-- TODO -->
Document optomisation Wilsons vs regular factorial
regular factoral has data type size limit
Wilsons means cannot be cache as each iteration
